DQAOA
1. Code runtime environment
   The environment required by this project is placed in the file environment.txt. The main environ-ment is briefly described below:
   Python ==3.12.1
   Jupyter ==1.0.0
   Jupyter Server ==2.14.0
   Qiskit ==1.1.1
   Qiskit-aer ==0.14.2
   cvxpy ==1.5.2
   networkx ==3.2.1
   You can install all the dependencies listed in the environment.txt file by running the command “pip install -r environment.txt” in the same directory where the file is located. Please note that this process may take approximately one hour or longer. Ensure that the required configuration packages are installed within the same environment. You may choose to set up a virtual environment or install the packages directly into the system environment, while maintaining version consistency as much as possible.
   All the code for this project is designed to run in Jupyter Notebook, which is why most files have the .ipynb extension. Although the files can be converted to run in other IDEs, the DQAOA CORE.ipynb file involves quantum circuits and relies on additional supporting files for proper execution. As a result, it is strongly recommended to run this file within the Jupyter environment.
2. random_graph.ipynb
   This program is designed to generate a connected Erdős-Rényi graph with a specified number of vertices and a defined probability for edge creation between them. The weight of each vertex is assigned arbitrarily within a default range of [1, 20], which can also be customized by the user if needed.
3. random_graph.pkl
   This file serves for storing the connected graph generated by the random Graph.ipynb script.
4. greedy and SDP_random .ipynb
   This program open random_graph.pkl to load the connected graph generated in the previous step. It then applies a greedy algorithm to identify the maximum weight independent set (WMIS) of the graph and calculates the corresponding cumulative weights, which serve as the lower bound. Additionally, it employs semidefinite programming (SDP) to determine the upper bound of the cumulative weights for WMIS in the graph.
5. DQAOA CORE .ipynb
   This file contains the core implementation of the DQAOA algorithm, as outlined in Algorithm 2 of our paper. The program takes an input value $k$, which is used to construct the corresponding Dicke state—a uniform superposition state with a Hamming weight equal to $k$. The output of the program is a WMIS (Weighted Maximum Independent Set) solution constrained within the subspace of this uniform superposition state. The global WMIS is then determined by comparing the results across all $k_l - k_1 +1$ branches.
